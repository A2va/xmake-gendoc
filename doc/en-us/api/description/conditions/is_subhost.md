### is_subhost

#### Determine the subsystem environment of the current host

At present, it is mainly used for detection of cygwin, msys2 and other subsystem environments on windows systems. If you run xmake in the msys2 shell environment, then `is_subhost("windows")` will return false, and `is_host("windows")` It will still return true.

Currently supported subsystems:

* "msys"
* "cygwin"

Configuration example:

```lua
if ${link is_subhost}("msys", "cygwin") then
    -- Currently in the shell environment of msys2/cygwin
end
```

We can also quickly check the current subsystem platform by executing `xmake l os.subhost`.

> âš  **It may also support other subsystem environments under linux and macos systems later, if they exist.**
